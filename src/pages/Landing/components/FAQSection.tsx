			question:
				"What is the Nutcoin Ecosystem and its connection to NUTPAL AI?",
			answer: (
				<>
					<p>
						NUTPAL AI is a flagship project born from the innovative spirit of
						the Nutcoin Ecosystem â€“ a vibrant, community-driven Web3 space.
						While NUTPAL AI is a standalone application focused on delivering
						cutting-edge AI experiences, it shares the ecosystem's commitment to
						community, transparency, and leveraging technology to create unique
						value. <br /> <br />
						The Nutcoin token (NUT) and NUTS NFTs from Nutcoin Ecosystem play a
						special role in enhancing your NUTPAL AI experience:
					</p>
					<ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5 text-ga-white-darker">
						<li>
							<strong className="text-ga-white-default">
								NUT Token Discounts:
							</strong>{" "}
							Get discounted rates when paying premium features with NUT tokens.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong className="text-ga-white-default">
								NUTS NFT Holder Perks (only 10k total):
							</strong>{" "}
							Access exclusive features and permanent discounts with NUTS NFT
							ownership.

					</ul>
				</>

		{
			question: "Why are only cryptocurrencies accepted for premium features?",
			answer: (
				<>
					We prioritize your privacy and believe in the empowering nature of
					decentralized technologies. Accepting cryptocurrencies for premium
					services allows for greater user anonymity and aligns with our Web3
					ethos. It also enables seamless integration with the Nutcoin
					Ecosystem, allowing us to offer unique benefits to NUT and NUTS
					holders.

		{
			question:
				"How does revenue from NUTPAL AI support the Nutcoin Ecosystem?",
			answer: (
				<>
					Revenue generated from NUTPAL AI's premium services is designed to
					create a sustainable and deflationary cycle for the Nutcoin Ecosystem.
					A significant portion will be used to buy back NUT tokens from the
					market, which are then burned to mint NUTS NFTs. These NUTS NFTs, in
					turn, unlock unique features in NUTPAL AI, creating a continuous loop
					that benefits both NUTPAL AI users and the broader Nutcoin community
					by enhancing token value and NFT utility. <br /> <br />
